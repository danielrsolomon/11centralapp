# Web Search MCP Setup Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created a dedicated MCP server** for web search capabilities using the Brave Search API
   - Set up in the `mcp-websearch` directory
   - Configured to run on port 3100 (to avoid conflicts with the existing Supabase MCP)
   - Implemented with Express.js and Axios

2. **Implemented robust error handling and fallbacks**
   - Added validation for API key and query parameters
   - Created fallback mechanisms for API issues
   - Implemented mock results when the API is unavailable

3. **Set up MCP configuration for Cursor.ai**
   - Created the configuration in `cursor/mcp/websearch.json`
   - Defined the interface for the web search functionality

4. **Created helper scripts**
   - `start-websearch-mcp.sh` for starting just the Web Search MCP
   - `start-mcp-services.sh` for starting both the Supabase MCP and Web Search MCP

5. **Added comprehensive documentation**
   - Created README files with setup and usage instructions
   - Added troubleshooting guides
   - Included testing instructions

## How to Use

1. Start the MCP services:
   ```bash
   ./start-mcp-services.sh
   ```
   
   Or start just the Web Search MCP:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-websearch && ./start-websearch-mcp.sh
   ```

2. In Cursor.ai, use the following syntax to search the web:
   ```
   @web-search query="your search query here"
   ```

## Current Status

The Web Search MCP is now set up and functioning. It will return real results from the Brave Search API when possible, or fall back to mock results if there are API issues.

The server is configured with the Brave Search API key: `BSA7OX87zwMNti3n1C4eYFUsNOlxPEF`

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Cursor.ai**: Try using the `@web-search` command in Cursor.ai to verify the integration works correctly.

2. **Monitor API usage**: Keep an eye on the terminal output when using the web search functionality to ensure the API is working correctly.

3. **Update API key if needed**: If you encounter persistent issues with the Brave Search API, you may need to generate a new API key from the [Brave Search API Dashboard](https://brave.com/search/api).

Setup complete! You can now use @web-search to get up-to-date information as of March 15, 2025.
