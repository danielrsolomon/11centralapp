# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

The E11EVEN Central App is an all-in-one platform designed to streamline workforce management, employee training, internal communication, scheduling, and tip tracking. This document explains the reasoning behind each technology used in the app in everyday language. Our goal is to bring together a set of powerful tools that work seamlessly to support a wide variety of roles – from SuperAdmins and Managers to frontline Staff – while ensuring an intuitive and responsive user experience that works well on both desktops and mobile devices.

## Frontend Technologies

For the visual part of the application, we chose a modern, lightweight, and fast setup with Vite.js as the main development tool. We use React with Typescript to create reliable and maintainable user interfaces. Tailwind CSS helps us quickly build a clean, minimalist design that respects the branding guidelines focused on a gold-dominated color scheme, supporting both light and dark themes via next-themes. In addition, Shadcn UI provides easily customizable UI components that speed up development and keep the look consistent across the app. To handle forms, we use React Hook Form together with Zod. This combination makes sure that all the forms are smooth to use and validate data efficiently, keeping the user experience simple and error-free.

## Backend Technologies

On the backend, the system is built around Supabase. Supabase acts as the heart of the data management, handling the database, real-time data, user authentication, and file storage. This reliable service makes it easy to handle everything from user profiles to complex training progress tracking. In addition, backend logic is developed with modern standards so that data flows smoothly between different parts of the app. This setup supports robust role-based access and keeps data synchronized between the learning modules, messaging system, scheduling module, and gratuity tracking – all working together without hiccups.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The project is hosted on a stable and scalable platform that leverages version control and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. By using Git for version control and integrating tools that help with automated testing and deployment, our development process remains consistent and error-free. This structure not only ensures that updates are rolled out safely but also allows the system to scale when the number of users or data volume grows. All aspects of the infrastructure emphasize reliability, easy management, and faster time-to-market for new features.

## Third-Party Integrations

Several external services are seamlessly integrated into the E11EVEN Central App to extend its functionality. The OpenAI API is used to power the AI-driven scheduling feature. This integration helps create shift schedules based on historical data, current employee availability, and business rules. Another key integration is with the Micros Symphony API, which is critical for pulling point-of-sale data and supporting floorplan assignments. Furthermore, the system is designed to easily connect with ERP, HR, and payroll systems like ADP or QuickBooks, tying training, scheduling, and tip management together in one comprehensive operational hub.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is a top priority in our tech stack. The app employs secure role-based authentication and real-time data encryption both in transit and at rest, complying with GDPR and IRS regulations. With Supabase handling authentication and data storage, users’ sensitive information remains protected. The messaging system, for example, supports configurable chat history retention and archive options with strict encryption. On the performance side, Vite.js ensures fast load times and smooth interactions like drag-and-drop scheduling and real-time notifications. Additionally, robust error handling along with optimized CSS and JavaScript ensures the system remains responsive even when handling intensive tasks such as AI-powered recommendations or real-time updates.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

To sum up, the choice of technologies in the E11EVEN Central App revolves around delivering a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience. The frontend benefits from React with Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI, which together create a clean and responsive interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The backend is robustly managed with Supabase, ensuring that data flows, authentication, and communication run flawlessly. Integrations with the OpenAI API and Micros Symphony API further enhance the scheduling and tip management capabilities. With clear focus on security, performance, and scalability, this tech stack is well-aligned to meet the modern needs of enterprise workforce management while keeping the overall system easy to maintain and upgrade in the future.
